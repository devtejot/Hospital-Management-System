# Hospital-Management-System
Hospital-Management-System is a software application designed to manage the day-to-day operations of a hospital or medical facility. This system helps healthcare professionals to efficiently manage their patients' medical information, appointments, billing, and other administrative tasks.

In this project I created a Hospital Management System from scratch. The Hospital Management fullstack application project aims to utilize the MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS) stack to create a fully functional and user-friendly platform for users. The project is built using MongoDB as the database for storing user data, ExpressJS for the backend API and handling server-side logic, ReactJS for the frontend user interface, and NodeJS for running the application.
